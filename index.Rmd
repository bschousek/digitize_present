# Plot Digitizer


## A tool for extracting numerical data from bitmap files.


&copy; Brian Schousek, 2014.<br> Developed as a project for Developing Data Products, a course in the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=dashboard">Johns Hopkins/Coursera Data Science Specialization.</a>

## The Problem

* You have been assigned to confirm the results of a study performed in 1998.

* Unfortunately the magnetic tapes which contained all of the data from the study were used to prop up a poorly shielded CRT monitor. Those tapes are now all blank.

* The only remaining artifacts of the study are some grainy bitmap plots posted to now defunct geocities.com, and are only available at archive.org.

### The Solution: Plot Digitizer

<img src="./assets/img/screencap.png" height="450px">

[Plot Digitizer](http://bruno.shinyapps.io/digitize) extracts trace data from bitmap plots and allows the user to save it in an R dataframe.

### Methods


* [Plot Digitizer](http://bruno.shinyapps.io/digitize) loads the image into R and performs hierarchical cluster analysis.
* Plots can be jpeg, bitmap, or png. (Sorry, 16 color animated pegasus gifs not supported.)
* The user can choose how many color levels are to remain in the resulting data.
* The user can also choose which of the extracted colors are plotted and saved to the R data file.
* Liberal use of reactive() shiny functions keeps the response snappy.
``` {r echo=FALSE }
library(knitr)
set.seed(234)
sampledata=data.frame(x=rnorm(10),y=rnorm(10))

```
``` {r plot,fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
clusters=hclust(dist(sampledata))
plot(clusters,ann=FALSE)
```
